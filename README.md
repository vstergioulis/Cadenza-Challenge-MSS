# Cadenza-Challenge-MSS
Our repo for the to be presented system for Cadenza Challenge Cad2 Task 2: Rebalancing Classical Music Task

Here we only present the proposed system for Music Source Separation, which was not submitted to the challenge due to time limitations (in 2025 we were still Undergraduate and the semester was not kind to us :-( 
).
If one wishes to run the proposed system, or even better enhance its performance contact us in: vstergioulis@uth.gr and spetroglou@uth.gr
